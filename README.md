# JavaScript Drum Kit
## [JavaScript30.com](https://javascript30.com/) Challenge \#01

HTML is original and not modified, written by Wes Bos. Same with CSS, I only added @media in CSS.


In JavaScript, the keyboard part I coded along with the video tutorial.

My son liked it very much and wanted it to work on his smart phone, so I added also the click listener. Function *playSoundClick* is mine.

A BIG thank you to Wes Bos for these challenges!
